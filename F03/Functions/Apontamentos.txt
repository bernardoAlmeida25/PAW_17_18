Let's explore each part in detail.
-----------------------xxx-------------------
1. We created a function named pressPowerButton.

const pressPowerButton creates a variable with a given name written in camelCase.

The variable is then set equal = to a set of parentheses followed by an arrow token () =>, indicating the variable stores a function. This syntax is known as arrow function syntax.

Finally, between the curly braces {} is the function body, or the JavaScript statements that define the function. This is followed by a semi-colon ;. In JavaScript, any code between curly braces is also known as a block.

Functions are written to perform a task.
Functions take data, perform a set of tasks on the data, and then return the result.
We can define parameters to be used when calling the function.
When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.
We can use return to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.
